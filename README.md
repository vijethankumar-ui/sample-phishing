# Phishing Email Analysis

This repository contains a short analysis of a **sample phishing email**, focusing on spoofing, suspicious links, tone, and URL masking.  

---

## Steps Followed

1. **Obtain a Sample Phishing Email**  
   A mock phishing message was analyzed.

2. **Examine Sender's Email Address for Spoofing**  
   The sender address contained random words and did not match known organization domains ‚Äî a clear sign of spoofing.

3. **Check for Suspicious Links or Attachments**  
   - The email included a ‚Äúverify security footage‚Äù link which hid its true destination (URL masking).  
   - Hovering over the link revealed a mismatched and suspicious URL.

4. **Identify Urgent or Threatening Language**  
   - The line ‚ÄúWe are currently looking into and need your prompt assistance‚Äù attempts to induce urgency and compliance.  
   - Legitimate corporate communication would be more formal and contextual.

5. **Verify Real URL**  
   - By hovering, the real link was revealed ‚Äî unrelated to the supposed organization.

6. **Summarize Findings**
   - **Spoofed sender address**
   - **URL masking**
   - **Urgent tone**
   - **Unfamiliar link target**
   - **Potential attachment risk**
