# Phishing Email Analysis

1. This is a sample phishing email.

2. **Spoofing:**  
   The sender’s address is a mix of jumbled and random words which is suspicious. Since the recipient is familiar with the office’s real email addresses, a unique or random address clearly indicates phishing.

3. **Suspicious Links:**  
   The “verify security footage” link hides the real URL. This is called URL masking. The word *attachment* could also hide a malicious link.

4. **Urgent Tone:**  
   “We are currently looking into and need your prompt assistance” creates a false sense of urgency and authority — a common phishing tactic.

5. **Real URL Check:**  
   Hovering over the “view security footage” link reveals a mismatched URL. Analyzing this link helps verify authenticity.
